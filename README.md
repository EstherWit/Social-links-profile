## My process
I started by adding basic HTML elements such as <p> and <img>, then grouped related elements using <div> tags for better structure.

In the CSS, I began by styling the broader elements like body and div, then moved on to more specific tags like <p> and <img>. This helped maintain a clean, top-down styling approach.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned the importance of consistently applying Flexbox properties such as display: flex;, justify-content: center;, and align-items: center; when necessary. These properties greatly improved my layout and spacing, especially in areas where I previously struggled with alignment in past projects.


### Continued development
Iâ€™m interested in exploring CSS Grid in future projects. It seems like a powerful layout tool and would be a valuable addition to my skillset, even though I currently have no experience with it.
